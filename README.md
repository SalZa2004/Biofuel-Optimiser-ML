# Predicting Optimal Biofuel Composition Using Machine Learning

This project aims to develop a machine learning (ML)-based model for predicting the best 
biofuel compositions tailored for certain applications and engine types. With the world turning 
towards green energy, biofuels represent an acceptable substitute for fossil fuels. However, it 
takes time and is costly to experiment to determine the best combination of bio-components 
such as ethanol, biodiesel, and other biomass-derived fuels. By applying data-driven 
approaches, the project seeks to improve the process of finding compositions that achieve 
efficiency maximisation, emissions minimisation, and maintaining engine performance. 

The system will use the past record of fuel compositions, combustion properties, and engine 
performance parameters to train supervised machine learning algorithms. The algorithm will 
learn to map certain fuel compositions to target output values (e.g. energy density, emissions 
profile, ignition delay). The aim is to create a predictive model that can suggest biofuel 
compositions for specific constraints or applications, e.g. heavy transport, air transport, power 
generation. This study has the potential to speed up greener fuel adoption and aid in 
decarbonisation efforts in different industries.
